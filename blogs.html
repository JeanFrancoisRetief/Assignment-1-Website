            <br><br>Setting up Git: I had already set up GitHub and GitHub Desktop last year for a game design group project and learned quite a bit from the experience. Although we mainly needed it for collaboration back then, but we also learned to use it as a global backup for our project.
            <br><br>Reading Reflections: “The Library of Babel” reading really put into perspective how overwhelming the amount of information we have today, emphasized by the fact that people were overwhelmed even before the internet (when they just had access to “finite libraries”). The website with the same name also puts into perspective just how incomprehensively large the internet is (because of this website alone, the internet already contains almost every sentence that can ever be written). As discussed in class, it was noted that this increase in access to information contributed to the shortening of our attention spans, which allows us to process more information than previous generations, just in smaller bits. I heard it often said that technology is the next step in human evolution, and if these small adaptations are anything to go by, that statement might just be true.
            <br><br>Case Studies: When comparing the usability of the Wits Home Site and Ulwazi’s Dashboard, it is clear that the Wits Home Site is in dire need of improvement. On the main page, the interactable parts of the site aren’t prominent enough. You have to scroll down to access the “search courses” section and as you scroll down further, the inconsistent placement of images and text makes it a chore to navigate. In contrast, Ulwazi’s Dashboard is much easier (and pleasant) to use. Everything on the site is neatly organized into sections (important tabs on the left, courses in the centre, and important announcements on the right). Taking my favourite website, Youtube, as another case study: there are things that I like and dislike about the site. I like that, similar to Ulwazi’s Dashboard, the site is clearly split up between important tabs on the left, and the videos on the right. There is also a few small “quality of life” things (like the videos previewing if you hover your mouse over the thumbnail and displaying how much of a video you have watched already at the bottom of the thumbnail) that really make the site more pleasant to use. I don’t like the increasing frequency of advertisements on the site, but I understand that is required for the site to make a profit.
            <br><br>My goals for this course: I want to qualify as a “successful student” as described in the “Course Outcomes” section of the CBO.

            <br><br>My experience starting with HTML: For the most part, learning HTML gives a very similar feeling to learning any new programming language. The only major difference in approach that I need to get used to, is the semantic tags. Now I must wrap my functional code in containers and tags that are useless for the running of the code, but helps with search engine optimization. It is interesting to see all the tags that functionally do the same thing, but differ semantically. This will be an adjustment, but I’m excited to continue learning more about HTML.
            <br><br>Readings: In the “As We May Think – At 65” reading, Bush’s work was re-examined in 2010, and it reinforces the feeling of being overwhelmed that last week’s readings handled. No matter when you re-examine reading like these, or when they were originally written, there will be a sense of the writer grappling with the unimaginable scale of future advancements and technologies. Although Bush seemed prescient when he described a future technology, “MEMEX” very similar to what we know today as the internet, he simply grappled with what was needed in the future (a vast repository of human knowledge), not what would definitely be. He knew the nature of what advancements would likely be made, but not the form they will take.
            <br><br>Internet Histories: The different timelines looked at in class really put the progression of the internet into perspective. The internet, like most technologies, had an exponential growth rate. It was already growing fast in the 1990s, but today it is impossible to visualize just how big and how fast the internet is growing. The section of the theory lecture that handled the “browser wars” and “the life and death of the Flash player” also helps with putting the history of the internet into perspective. Even though the internet is only a few decades old, there were mountains of technologies and ideas that were used, changed, upgraded, and discarded within that relatively short time frame.

            <br><br>My experience continuing website development: This week, we started to learn CSS, and how to integrate it with HTML. It is convention to put the styling in a separate file, which is a further example of focussing semantics and convention, rather than simply focussing on functionality. It is possible to embed the styling the same file as the HTML coding, but it is considered good practice to separate it. This semantic approach to coding is the main difference between HTML (and CSS) coding and coding I’ve done in the past. Coding websites must be approached differently, to take into account web crawlers, search engine optimization, screen readers, and anything that needs to understand what is inside of my website (touched upon in the reading: “Lawson, B - How a Screen  Reader User accesses the Web”).
            <br><br>Reading: In “Convention and Context, Mailloux, 1983” the whole idea of convention and semantics is touched upon. The reading gives multiple viewpoints and definitions of convention and conventions in context. The loose definition I most agree with, in the context of web development, is that convention is “quasi agreements” about how something must be done, for example: using ‘sections’ or ‘article’ instead of a simple ‘div’ to help the web crawler to understand the contents of your website.
            <br><br>Reflection on the lecture: Similar to the abovementioned reading, the lecture gave different definitions of a single term, this time the term is: interaction. It is difficult to have a meaningful definition of “interaction” in the context of the web since anything digital is technically “interactable”. For the context of web development, interaction should be split into two categories: trivial (does not meaningfully change the content of the webpage) and non-trivial (does modify the webpage in a meaningful way). What falls in each category should be evaluated on a case-by-case / user-by-user / website-by-website basis.

            <br><br> My experience continuing website development: This week, we started to learn JavaScript. I am much more comfortable with this type of coding since is very similar to code I’ve done before (C++ and C#). It is clear to see just how dynamic a website can be made with JS and how stylish with CSS, but one must take care not to put style before substance. The UI must be clear, easy, and fast for the user to remain interested in the website, so slow transitions, loading screens, and difficult-to-read styling are to be avoided, even if they look good. 
            <br><br>Reading: In “The Basic Principles of User Interface Design” a bunch of helpful tips is given to take into consideration. But as the reading itself says: it all pretty much boils down to making it easier for the user to interact with the UI. UI Design is, obviously, user-centric. In “Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology, Gibson, 2004” describes less traditional UI systems and input methods. Some of which, like the “Hands-free” systems, have improved vastly since the reading was written. For example, at Wits, many of the card-interfaces at entrances have been replaced by touchless, biometric scanners, to make entrance to the university easier. It is simpler, clearer, reduces cognitive load, and provides useful feedback, as recommended in the first reading.
            <br><br>Reflection on the lecture on UI and Interactivity: Similar to last week’s discussion on interactivity, and its many definitions and debates of said definitions, Interface and User Experience also has many viewpoints and interpretations. The ideas of “interactivity” and “interface” are inherently linked: they are the action and the representation. The idea of interface elements being both “the item” and “the action” showcases the intrinsic link between these ideas. As mentioned in the lecture, many aspects of design do not have a mutually exclusive relationship with others. Many aspects form many different and complicated Venn-diagrams.
            <br><br>UI and my wireframes: My first attempt at wireframes did not take into account the alignment between the developer goals (my goals) and the user goals. For our assignment a suggested information/content hierarchy is given, so it is easier now just to consider the user’s goals, wants, possible pet-peeves, and overall experience, as well as any interface elements that might be needed to traverse between these moments of user experience. My new attempts are better, but as an engineering student: I’ve not been exposed to many portfolio-type websites, so I definitely want to investigate examples in the following weeks to see what wireframes and site-layouts work and don’t work.
