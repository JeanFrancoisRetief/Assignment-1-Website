The website with the same name also puts into perspective just how incomprehensively large the internet is (because of this website alone, the internet already contains almost every sentence that can ever be written). As discussed in class, it was noted that this increase in access to information contributed to the shortening of our attention spans, which allows us to process more information than previous generations, just in smaller bits. I heard it often said that technology is the next step in human evolution, and if these small adaptations are anything to go by, that statement might just be true.</p>",
        "par3": "<p>Case Studies: When comparing the usability of the Wits Home Site and Ulwazi’s Dashboard, it is clear that the Wits Home Site is in dire need of improvement. On the main page, the interactable parts of the site aren’t prominent enough. You have to scroll down to access the “search courses” section and as you scroll down further, the inconsistent placement of images and text makes it a chore to navigate. In contrast, Ulwazi’s Dashboard is much easier (and pleasant) to use. Everything on the site is neatly organized into sections (important tabs on the left, courses in the centre, and important announcements on the right). Taking my favourite website, Youtube, as another case study: there are things that I like and dislike about the site. I like that, similar to Ulwazi’s Dashboard, the site is clearly split up between important tabs on the left, and the videos on the right. There is also a few small “quality of life” things (like the videos previewing if you hover your mouse over the thumbnail and displaying how much of a video you have watched already at the bottom of the thumbnail) that really make the site more pleasant to use. I don’t like the increasing frequency of advertisements on the site, but I understand that is required for the site to make a profit.</p>",

The only major difference in approach that I need to get used to, is the semantic tags. Now I must wrap my functional code in containers and tags that are useless for the running of the code, but helps with search engine optimization. It is interesting to see all the tags that functionally do the same thing, but differ semantically. This will be an adjustment, but I’m excited to continue learning more about HTML.</p>",
        "par2": "<p>Readings: In the “As We May Think – At 65” reading, Bush’s work was re-examined in 2010, and it reinforces the feeling of being overwhelmed that last week’s readings handled. No matter when you re-examine reading like these, or when they were originally written, there will be a sense of the writer grappling with the unimaginable scale of future advancements and technologies. Although Bush seemed prescient when he described a future technology, “MEMEX” very similar to what we know today as the internet, he simply grappled with what was needed in the future (a vast repository of human knowledge), not what would definitely be. He knew the nature of what advancements would likely be made, but not the form they will take.</p>",

The internet, like most technologies, had an exponential growth rate. It was already growing fast in the 1990s, but today it is impossible to visualize just how big and how fast the internet is growing. The section of the theory lecture that handled the “browser wars” and “the life and death of the Flash player” also helps with putting the history of the internet into perspective. Even though the internet is only a few decades old, there were mountains of technologies and ideas that were used, changed, upgraded, and discarded within that relatively short time frame.</p>",

        "par1": "<p>My experience continuing website development: This week, we started to learn CSS, and how to integrate it with HTML. It is convention to put the styling in a separate file, which is a further example of focussing semantics and convention, rather than simply focussing on functionality. It is possible to embed the styling the same file as the HTML coding, but it is considered good practice to separate it. This semantic approach to coding is the main difference between HTML (and CSS) coding and coding I’ve done in the past. Coding websites must be approached differently, to take into account web crawlers, search engine optimization, screen readers, and anything that needs to understand what is inside of my website (touched upon in the reading: “Lawson, B - How a Screen  Reader User accesses the Web”).</p>",
        "par2": "<p>Reading: In “Convention and Context, Mailloux, 1983” the whole idea of convention and semantics is touched upon. The reading gives multiple viewpoints and definitions of convention and conventions in context. The loose definition I most agree with, in the context of web development, is that convention is “quasi agreements” about how something must be done, for example: using ‘sections’ or ‘article’ instead of a simple ‘div’ to help the web crawler to understand the contents of your website.</p>",
        "par3": "<p>Reflection on the lecture: Similar to the abovementioned reading, the lecture gave different definitions of a single term, this time the term is: interaction. It is difficult to have a meaningful definition of “interaction” in the context of the web since anything digital is technically “interactable”. For the context of web development, interaction should be split into two categories: trivial (does not meaningfully change the content of the webpage) and non-trivial (does modify the webpage in a meaningful way). What falls in each category should be evaluated on a case-by-case / user-by-user / website-by-website basis.</p>",

        "par1": "<p>My experience continuing website development: This week, we started to learn JavaScript. I am much more comfortable with this type of coding since is very similar to code I’ve done before (C++ and C#). It is clear to see just how dynamic a website can be made with JS and how stylish with CSS, but one must take care not to put style before substance. The UI must be clear, easy, and fast for the user to remain interested in the website, so slow transitions, loading screens, and difficult-to-read styling are to be avoided, even if they look good.</p>",
        "par2": "<p>Reading: In “The Basic Principles of User Interface Design” a bunch of helpful tips is given to take into consideration. But as the reading itself says: it all pretty much boils down to making it easier for the user to interact with the UI. UI Design is, obviously, user-centric. In “Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology, Gibson, 2004” describes less traditional UI systems and input methods. Some of which, like the “Hands-free” systems, have improved vastly since the reading was written. For example, at Wits, many of the card-interfaces at entrances have been replaced by touchless, biometric scanners, to make entrance to the university easier. It is simpler, clearer, reduces cognitive load, and provides useful feedback, as recommended in the first reading.</p>",
        "par3": "<p>Reflection on the lecture on UI and Interactivity: Similar to last week’s discussion on interactivity, and its many definitions and debates of said definitions, Interface and User Experience also has many viewpoints and interpretations. The ideas of “interactivity” and “interface” are inherently linked: they are the action and the representation. The idea of interface elements being both “the item” and “the action” showcases the intrinsic link between these ideas. As mentioned in the lecture, many aspects of design do not have a mutually exclusive relationship with others. Many aspects form many different and complicated Venn-diagrams.</p>",
        "par4": "<p>UI and my wireframes: My first attempt at wireframes did not take into account the alignment between the developer goals (my goals) and the user goals. For our assignment a suggested information/content hierarchy is given, so it is easier now just to consider the user’s goals, wants, possible pet-peeves, and overall experience, as well as any interface elements that might be needed to traverse between these moments of user experience. My new attempts are better, but as an engineering student: I’ve not been exposed to many portfolio-type websites, so I definitely want to investigate examples in the following weeks to see what wireframes and site-layouts work and don’t work.</p>",

There is a constant push and pull between companies wanting to make a profit, and companies having to remain ethical during the pursuit of that profit. The same is true for an individual designer or engineer: our designs have real impacts on the users. Designers have the power to make almost anything, but they have a responsibility to put ethics before profit.</p>",

This reading reinforced the idea covered in previous lectures that we can try to design for a certain experience, but due to many factors out of our control, we cannot guarantee that experience.  The three perspectives highlighted by the reading essentially boil down to: aesthetics are also important (not just implementation), experience is subjective and not guarantee-able from a design perspective and a user’s emotion can be affected by your UX design, and this is one of the ethical concerns highlighted in this week’s theory lecture discussed above.</p>",

This article puts the ubiquity of these patterns into perspective: even large and well-known companies (such as Samsung, Facebook (Meta), Dominos, Microsoft, LinkedIn, etc.) often use some of these patterns to increase their profits or further their interests. While some of these practices can just be an annoyance (like hiding unsubscribe buttons or forcing users to subscribe to use a website), other practices are designed with the intent to trick the user to spend more money than they would otherwise (one of these, “Basket Sneaking”, is even illegal in some countries due to its unethical nature). Quite often, these patterns take advantage of users’ expectations and weaknesses. While this can be as harmless as switching the “ok” and “cancel” buttons in a pop-up that will take you to another website, a more insidious example from gaming is “loot boxes”. Loot boxes and casinos take advantage of the same phycological issues that gambling addicts have, but loot boxes have an advantage over traditional casinos: they are much more accessible and by a wider (and sometimes younger) audience. We as designers tend to manipulate users into using our products in a certain way, but we have a responsibility not to use this power for evil.</p>",

An example of content affected by this inequality: the many metrics used to study this digital divide (such as usage vs participation, internet access, cost of access, etc.) are in themselves biased by this divide -it is a self-fulfilling cycle.</p>",

This reading reinforces the idea of: the internet would’ve ideally promoted and facilitated equality in information access and search results, however in reality, tools (with good intentions) such as user-personalized search-result-optimization and personalization divide people more than ever. Attempts to mend by adding user-settings are not enough, since I can’t even count how many times I’ve been affected by the “Default effect” and didn’t pick the right settings for cites. </p>",

It’s troubling since AI in other fields has failed due to unexpected biases (for example the facial recognition for the USA’s border-control and asylum-seeking app struggles with people with darker skin tones, which are people more likely to need the app). AI’s existing blunders due to data structures and information hierarchies (caused by the colonialism of technology, its content, and the frameworks their built upon) have had terrible enough effects on human lives, even before it has been militarized. Just imagine an unmanned, AI-controlled bomber-drone, with faulty facial recognition algorithms that could target the wrong people. This reading floats around the idea of techno-colonialism being a “New Dark Age” – well at the very least it could bring about many Dark Times for humanity. And this is not even considering the economic effects on the Global South yet. The second part of the reading illustrates the idea of instead of countries from the northern hemisphere colonializing southern countries, today a new trend is emerging. Companies and Corporations from the Global North sudo-colonizing the Global South (while they don’t control the entire country, they definitely control industries within that country).</p>",

        "par4": "<p>This reading fits in nicely with the Verdi-reading since it starts out by stating the new colonizers are corporations (or at the very least, corporate agendas are what drive algorithmic colonization). It also reinforces the idea touched upon in this week’s recorded lecture of the Global North (specifically Western) strangle-hold on the AI industry (and software in general) prevents significant innovations within African countries since they are kept reliant on the Global North’s developments (similar effects were observer with traditional colonialism). The Global South is vulnerable in ways that the Global North rarely considers: solutions for a problem might work in certain counties in the Global North, but not in other places within the Global South. A good example is the adage “AI won’t replace workers, workers that use AI will replace workers that don’t”. While this might be true to an extent in more well countries in the Global North, it most certainly is not applicable to impoverished countries within Africa, where the majority of the workforce are manual-labourers that simply do not have access to the education needed to use, understand and work with new AI systems being developed day-to-day. The negative effects of any new technology are usually much less negative in the Global North and the colonies are usually the ones taken advantage of. </p>",

        "par1": "<p>Reflection on my website design (in context of the lecture “How we code matters”): Looking at the website I submitted, I can improve it greatly for the next submission by using JavaScript and responsive design. I did not include these, since they were not a requirement for the first submission, but I am going to include them now. There are many decisions (tiny “invisible decisions”) many designers make, like purely focusing on the project-requirements that have unintended effects. For me, it was a basic website without any fancy dynamic elements or media queries that allow the website to be viewed on different screen sizes, but if I was working on a more high-profile project – those effects could have been catastrophic. One day (hopefully) I might work on a high-profile game, so it is imperative that I learn the new literacy of looking critically at my code and considering possible hidden effects of my micro-decisions as soon as I can in my career.</p>",

        "par3": "<p>As discussed in lectures, everyone who goes through the current education system is primed to think in a certain “colonial” way. A good way to describe the epistemology we all learn is the scientific or “positivist” philosophy the reading describes. This philosophy, of considering reality as static, universal, and immutable, is the one adopted by many people in the technology sector, but – as I stated in last week’s blog – solutions are rarely “one-size-fits-all”. I.e., reality is ironically, rarely universal. As the reading concludes, a wider perspective needs to be adopted by any engineer or developer.</p>",

        "par1": "<p>Reflection on my website design: I am currently working on an engineering project that requires me to build a website (that allows the user to play Texas Hold’em Poker). It was originally planned to be multiplayer, which would have required RESTful API or a WebSockets server to run (any backend communication between players/clients). Now that it has been scoped down to a single-player version, the majority of the project is front-end JavaScript (which this course was extremely helpful for).  My group is going through the process highlighted in class of identifying a problem, Googling solutions, and adapting them or using them for our purposes (continuous research, even in the actual work environment). </p>",

        "par3": "<p>We have talked during lectures about an example of UI failure: the “Google gorilla fail”. That example illustrated how assumptions made during development (coding) can lead to disastrous outcomes. In that case, it was unintentional racism, but racial minorities aren’t the only ones affected by micro-assumptions and unintentional micro-aggressions made by software developers (which mostly consists of a cis-white-male majority). Gender minorities, such as trans and non-binary people, can also be affected. The case study of this reading (more accurately, the personal experience of the writer) illustrates the process of going through airport security as a nonbinary trans* femme. The algorithms exclude any non-normative people during scans. The reading goes on to mention other groups that are affected by different biases within airport customs. These groups include: disabled people, women of colour, people wearing religious clothing, etc. These micro-assumptions that are made on a coding-level, LEVEL UP to micro-aggressions or even macro-aggressions as the process goes further to implementation. The reading then shifts to a manifesto for the Design Justice process and principles. To horribly oversimply the 18 pages covering Design Justice: BE INCLUSIVE, in every step of the design process (hiring developers, actual development, testing, implementation).</p>",

//+"<p>Setting up Git: I had already set up GitHub and GitHub Desktop last year for a game design group project and learned quite a bit from the experience. Although we mainly needed it for collaboration back then, but we also learned to use it as a global backup for our project.</p>
//+"<p>Reading Reflections: “The Library of Babel” reading really put into perspective how overwhelming the amount of information we have today, emphasized by the fact that people were overwhelmed even before the internet (when they just had access to “finite libraries”). The website with the same name also puts into perspective just how incomprehensively large the internet is (because of this website alone, the internet already contains almost every sentence that can ever be written). As discussed in class, it was noted that this increase in access to information contributed to the shortening of our attention spans, which allows us to process more information than previous generations, just in smaller bits. I heard it often said that technology is the next step in human evolution, and if these small adaptations are anything to go by, that statement might just be true.</p>"
//+"<p>Case Studies: When comparing the usability of the Wits Home Site and Ulwazi’s Dashboard, it is clear that the Wits Home Site is in dire need of improvement. On the main page, the interactable parts of the site aren’t prominent enough. You have to scroll down to access the “search courses” section and as you scroll down further, the inconsistent placement of images and text makes it a chore to navigate. In contrast, Ulwazi’s Dashboard is much easier (and pleasant) to use. Everything on the site is neatly organized into sections (important tabs on the left, courses in the centre, and important announcements on the right). Taking my favourite website, Youtube, as another case study: there are things that I like and dislike about the site. I like that, similar to Ulwazi’s Dashboard, the site is clearly split up between important tabs on the left, and the videos on the right. There is also a few small “quality of life” things (like the videos previewing if you hover your mouse over the thumbnail and displaying how much of a video you have watched already at the bottom of the thumbnail) that really make the site more pleasant to use. I don’t like the increasing frequency of advertisements on the site, but I understand that is required for the site to make a profit.</p>"
