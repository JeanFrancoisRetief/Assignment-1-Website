                ~ 2458318 ~ Jean-Francois Retief ~ Week 1 - Blog Post
                <br><br>Setting up Git: I had already set up GitHub and GitHub Desktop last year for a game design group project and learned quite a bit from the experience. Although we mainly needed it for collaboration back then, but we also learned to use it as a global backup for our project.
                <br><br>Reading Reflections: “The Library of Babel” reading really put into perspective how overwhelming the amount of information we have today, emphasized by the fact that people were overwhelmed even before the internet (when they just had access to “finite libraries”). The website with the same name also puts into perspective just how incomprehensively large the internet is (because of this website alone, the internet already contains almost every sentence that can ever be written). As discussed in class, it was noted that this increase in access to information contributed to the shortening of our attention spans, which allows us to process more information than previous generations, just in smaller bits. I heard it often said that technology is the next step in human evolution, and if these small adaptations are anything to go by, that statement might just be true.
                <br><br>Case Studies: When comparing the usability of the Wits Home Site and Ulwazi’s Dashboard, it is clear that the Wits Home Site is in dire need of improvement. On the main page, the interactable parts of the site aren’t prominent enough. You have to scroll down to access the “search courses” section and as you scroll down further, the inconsistent placement of images and text makes it a chore to navigate. In contrast, Ulwazi’s Dashboard is much easier (and pleasant) to use. Everything on the site is neatly organized into sections (important tabs on the left, courses in the centre, and important announcements on the right). Taking my favourite website, Youtube, as another case study: there are things that I like and dislike about the site. I like that, similar to Ulwazi’s Dashboard, the site is clearly split up between important tabs on the left, and the videos on the right. There is also a few small “quality of life” things (like the videos previewing if you hover your mouse over the thumbnail and displaying how much of a video you have watched already at the bottom of the thumbnail) that really make the site more pleasant to use. I don’t like the increasing frequency of advertisements on the site, but I understand that is required for the site to make a profit.
                <br><br>My goals for this course: I want to qualify as a “successful student” as described in the “Course Outcomes” section of the CBO.

                ~ 2458318 ~ Jean-Francois Retief ~ Week 2 - Blog Post
                <br><br>My experience starting with HTML: For the most part, learning HTML gives a very similar feeling to learning any new programming language. The only major difference in approach that I need to get used to, is the semantic tags. Now I must wrap my functional code in containers and tags that are useless for the running of the code, but helps with search engine optimization. It is interesting to see all the tags that functionally do the same thing, but differ semantically. This will be an adjustment, but I’m excited to continue learning more about HTML.
                <br><br>Readings: In the “As We May Think – At 65” reading, Bush’s work was re-examined in 2010, and it reinforces the feeling of being overwhelmed that last week’s readings handled. No matter when you re-examine reading like these, or when they were originally written, there will be a sense of the writer grappling with the unimaginable scale of future advancements and technologies. Although Bush seemed prescient when he described a future technology, “MEMEX” very similar to what we know today as the internet, he simply grappled with what was needed in the future (a vast repository of human knowledge), not what would definitely be. He knew the nature of what advancements would likely be made, but not the form they will take.
                <br><br>Internet Histories: The different timelines looked at in class really put the progression of the internet into perspective. The internet, like most technologies, had an exponential growth rate. It was already growing fast in the 1990s, but today it is impossible to visualize just how big and how fast the internet is growing. The section of the theory lecture that handled the “browser wars” and “the life and death of the Flash player” also helps with putting the history of the internet into perspective. Even though the internet is only a few decades old, there were mountains of technologies and ideas that were used, changed, upgraded, and discarded within that relatively short time frame.

                ~ 2458318 ~ Jean-Francois Retief ~ Week 3 - Blog Post
                <br><br>My experience continuing website development: This week, we started to learn CSS, and how to integrate it with HTML. It is convention to put the styling in a separate file, which is a further example of focussing semantics and convention, rather than simply focussing on functionality. It is possible to embed the styling the same file as the HTML coding, but it is considered good practice to separate it. This semantic approach to coding is the main difference between HTML (and CSS) coding and coding I’ve done in the past. Coding websites must be approached differently, to take into account web crawlers, search engine optimization, screen readers, and anything that needs to understand what is inside of my website (touched upon in the reading: “Lawson, B - How a Screen  Reader User accesses the Web”).
                <br><br>Reading: In “Convention and Context, Mailloux, 1983” the whole idea of convention and semantics is touched upon. The reading gives multiple viewpoints and definitions of convention and conventions in context. The loose definition I most agree with, in the context of web development, is that convention is “quasi agreements” about how something must be done, for example: using ‘sections’ or ‘article’ instead of a simple ‘div’ to help the web crawler to understand the contents of your website.
                <br><br>Reflection on the lecture: Similar to the abovementioned reading, the lecture gave different definitions of a single term, this time the term is: interaction. It is difficult to have a meaningful definition of “interaction” in the context of the web since anything digital is technically “interactable”. For the context of web development, interaction should be split into two categories: trivial (does not meaningfully change the content of the webpage) and non-trivial (does modify the webpage in a meaningful way). What falls in each category should be evaluated on a case-by-case / user-by-user / website-by-website basis.

                ~ 2458318 ~ Jean-Francois Retief ~ Week 4 - Blog Post
                <br><br>My experience continuing website development: This week, we started to learn JavaScript. I am much more comfortable with this type of coding since is very similar to code I’ve done before (C++ and C#). It is clear to see just how dynamic a website can be made with JS and how stylish with CSS, but one must take care not to put style before substance. The UI must be clear, easy, and fast for the user to remain interested in the website, so slow transitions, loading screens, and difficult-to-read styling are to be avoided, even if they look good. 
                <br><br>Reading: In “The Basic Principles of User Interface Design” a bunch of helpful tips is given to take into consideration. But as the reading itself says: it all pretty much boils down to making it easier for the user to interact with the UI. UI Design is, obviously, user-centric. In “Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology, Gibson, 2004” describes less traditional UI systems and input methods. Some of which, like the “Hands-free” systems, have improved vastly since the reading was written. For example, at Wits, many of the card-interfaces at entrances have been replaced by touchless, biometric scanners, to make entrance to the university easier. It is simpler, clearer, reduces cognitive load, and provides useful feedback, as recommended in the first reading.
                <br><br>Reflection on the lecture on UI and Interactivity: Similar to last week’s discussion on interactivity, and its many definitions and debates of said definitions, Interface and User Experience also has many viewpoints and interpretations. The ideas of “interactivity” and “interface” are inherently linked: they are the action and the representation. The idea of interface elements being both “the item” and “the action” showcases the intrinsic link between these ideas. As mentioned in the lecture, many aspects of design do not have a mutually exclusive relationship with others. Many aspects form many different and complicated Venn-diagrams.
                <br><br>UI and my wireframes: My first attempt at wireframes did not take into account the alignment between the developer goals (my goals) and the user goals. For our assignment a suggested information/content hierarchy is given, so it is easier now just to consider the user’s goals, wants, possible pet-peeves, and overall experience, as well as any interface elements that might be needed to traverse between these moments of user experience. My new attempts are better, but as an engineering student: I’ve not been exposed to many portfolio-type websites, so I definitely want to investigate examples in the following weeks to see what wireframes and site-layouts work and don’t work.

                <br><br>While I spent most of these weeks finalizing my Game Design Assignment 1, I did however continue work on my website during this time. I worked on making my wireframes, style guide and other documentation more formal (for example: I took the wireframes that I had hand-drawn, recreated them digitally, and added annotations to explain my decisions and any changes I made during development).
                <br><br>These weeks’ technical lectures were about JavaScript concepts.  I am not using JavaScript for this assignment, but I can see how I would be able to improve my website, or any future websites I will make, by including simple JS. My Assignment 3 website will most likely be very different from my Assignment 1 website, due to the addition of JavaScript. I am purposely avoiding JavaScript for this first website, because it is not a requirement and it will create a more noticeable difference between my work on Assignment 1 and Assignment 3 (i.e. it will be a better showcase of my growth as a designer).

                ~ 2458318 ~ Jean-Francois Retief ~ Week 7 - Blog Post
                <br><br>My IxD Process during development of my website:
                <br><br>Goal Alignment: My goal is to allow the user (the marker) to easily navigate throughout my portfolio website which will contain a homepage, a blog section, a design section, an essay section, a profile screen, and a portfolio section.
                <br><br>Information Structure (Content Mapping): Every page as two nav-bars: one at the top of each page for navigating between pages and one fixed at the bottom of the screen to navigate within a single page. The homepage (the page that the website opens in) contains a brief introduction to the website and the navigation. The Blog page contains a blog-selection panel and the blogs themselves. The Design page will contain the style guide, wireframes as well as an explanation of my IxD process (similar to this part of this blog). The essay section will not have anything yet. The Portfolio page, similar to the blog page will contain an item-selection panel and the portfolio items themselves. Finally, the Profile page will contain a profile image and an “about the designer” section.
                <br><br>User Flow (Screens, Behaviour, Decisions): The user will start at the homepage. They can scroll down to read more, use the bottom nav-bar to quickly go to the bottom or top of the page, or use the top nav-bar to navigate to other pages. If the user goes to the Blog page or the Portfolio page, they can use the relevant selection panel to jump to their desired blog-post or portfolio item. They can also use the bottom nav-bar for the same purpose, or simply scroll down to the blog or item they wish to see. If the user goes to the Design page or Essay page, they can use the bottom nav-bar to navigate to desired sections/essays or they can simply scroll down. If the user goes to the Profile page, they can only navigate to another page after they’ve read the profile information, since the page is small and static (has no other interactivity).
                <br><br>Interface Elements: There are two ways the user can interact with my website, namely scrolling through each page OR clicking on links that will take the user elsewhere in that page or another page.
                <br><br>Design (Style Guide, Wireframes): In the design section on my website.
                <br><br>Implementation: Since JavaScript is not a requirement for this assignment, I decide to not use it at all, and make the website with a more restricted set of tools. This will create a much clearer distinction between this website and my next one, as well as show clearer growth as a designer throughout my assignment submissions.
                <br><br>Reflection on the lecture on Ethics of UX Practice: this lecture went well with the content we’re working on in one of my other courses: Professional Practice and Software Development. There is a constant push and pull between companies wanting to make a profit, and companies having to remain ethical during the pursuit of that profit. The same is true for an individual designer or engineer: our designs have real impacts on the users. Designers have the power to make almost anything, but they have a responsibility to put ethics before profit.
                <br><br>Reading: In “User experience - a research agenda, Hassenzahl and Tractinsky, 2006” a more engineering-like point of view was taken during an analysis of UX. This reading reinforced the idea covered in previous lectures that we can try to design for a certain experience, but due to many factors out of our control, we cannot guarantee that experience.  The three perspectives highlighted by the reading essentially boil down to: aesthetics are also important (not just implementation), experience is subjective and not guarantee-able from a design perspective and a user’s emotion can be affected by your UX design, and this is one of the ethical concerns highlighted in this week’s theory lecture discussed above.

                ~ 2458318 ~ Jean-Francois Retief ~ Extra Discussion on an article concerning dark UX patterns.
                <br><br>The article I found, “Dark Patterns: A New Scientific Look At UX Deception”[1] looked at many different examples and types of Dark Patterns in use. This article puts the ubiquity of these patterns into perspective: even large and well-known companies (such as Samsung, Facebook (Meta), Dominos, Microsoft, LinkedIn, etc.) often use some of these patterns to increase their profits or further their interests. While some of these practices can just be an annoyance (like hiding unsubscribe buttons or forcing users to subscribe to use a website), other practices are designed with the intent to trick the user to spend more money than they would otherwise (one of these, “Basket Sneaking”, is even illegal in some countries due to its unethical nature). Quite often, these patterns take advantage of users’ expectations and weaknesses. While this can be as harmless as switching the “ok” and “cancel” buttons in a pop-up that will take you to another website, a more insidious example from gaming is “loot boxes”. Loot boxes and casinos take advantage of the same phycological issues that gambling addicts have, but loot boxes have an advantage over traditional casinos: they are much more accessible and by a wider (and sometimes younger) audience. We as designers tend to manipulate users into using our products in a certain way, but we have a responsibility not to use this power for evil.
